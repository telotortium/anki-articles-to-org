# Anki Articles to Org

A simple package to perform a read-only export of the contents of my
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) Articles deck to Org, in order to have these
files present in Org-Roam.

The exported files are made read-only so that I don't accidentally update them
from Emacs - any notes I might want to take should be done in another file that
references the card, or else directly in Anki, which should be the source of
truth.
