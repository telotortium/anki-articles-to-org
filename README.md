# Anki Articles to Org

A simple package to perform a read-only export of the contents of my
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) Articles deck to Org, in order to have these
files present in Org-Roam.

The exported files are not meant to be edited. Any notes I might want to take
should be done in another file that references the card, or else directly in
Anki, which should be the source of truth.

For more info about my Anki Articles deck, see
